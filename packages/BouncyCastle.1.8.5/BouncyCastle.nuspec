    <description>The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C# implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at [http://www.bouncycastle.org](http://www.bouncycastle.org). In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, TSP, X.509 certificate generation and a variety of other standards such as OpenPGP.</description>
    <summary>Bouncy Castle is a collection of APIs used in cryptography.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>IMPORTANT
This is the final feature release with support for legacy .NET platforms. From 1.9.0 we will be targeting more modern .NET frameworks (see https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/pull/68) and updating our build and packaging systems. The 1.8.x series will continue to receive bug fixes, but limited new functionality.

Additional Features and Functionality:
- Supported added for encoding and decoding of GOST3410-2012 keys.
- Basic support added for CMP (RFC 4210) and CRMF (RFC 4211), including the PKI archive control.</releaseNotes>
